# iambored-mac

This is the mac version of [iambored](https://github.com/TheBlckbird/iambored)  
To use go to the releases page, download and move the app into your `Programs` Directory.  
Then just launch it.  
It will say that you can't launch this app because it isn't signed. [Here are more informations on how to launch it anyway](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/open-a-mac-app-from-an-unidentified-developer-mh40616/mac)  
To launch this program automatically on startup you have to drag and drop the application into the dock and right click it: Options->open on login.
Now you can remove it from your dock because you don't need it there anymore.
